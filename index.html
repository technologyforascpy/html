      <b><i>Batman</i></b> is the superhero protector of <b><i>Gotham city</i></b>, a man dressed like a bat who fights against evil
      and strikes
      terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his secret identity he is <b><i>Bruce Wayne</i></b>,
      billionaire
      industrialist
      and notorious playboy. Although he has no superhuman powers, he is one of the world's smartest men and greatest
      fighters. His physical prowess and technical ingenuity make him an incredibly dangerous opponent.

      <b><i>Princess Diana</i></b> grew up <b><i>Themyscira</i></b>, otherwise known as <ins><i>Paradise
          Island</i></ins>. This island
      full of only women is
      completely
      detached from man’s world. The group formed their own society and cultivated their world. Diana grew up believing
      she was born from clay, but it wasn’t until later that it was revealed that Diana did indeed have a father, that
      being Zeus. She trained with the God of War as she was growing up, only to leave him after she realised the
      importance of mercy. Later on she meets her first mortal man, Steve Trevor after he crashed on the island. This
      eventually leads her to man’s world where she becomes Wonder Woman.

      <b><i>Peter</i></b> can cling to most surfaces, has superhuman strength (able to lift 10 tons optimally) and is
      roughly 15 times
      more agile than a regular human. The combination of his acrobatic leaps and web-slinging enables him to travel
      rapidly from place to place. His <ins><i>spider-sense</i></ins> provides an early warning detection system linked
      with
      his
      superhuman
      kinesthetics, enabling him the ability to evade most any injury, provided he doesn't cognitively override the
      autonomic reflexes.
