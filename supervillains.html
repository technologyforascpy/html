    <h2> <a name="joker" id="joker"></a>The JOKER</h2>
    <p> The Joker, Clown Prince of Crime, is Batman's arch-nemesis. An agent of
      chaos known for his malicious plots, wacky gadgets and insidious smile, he
      has caused Batman more suffering than any other villain he has ever faced.
      His origin, name, and true motivations remain a mystery.</p>

    <h2> <a name="magneto" id="magneto"></a>MAGNETO</h2>
    <p> Among the most powerful, recognizable, and infamous mutants to inhabit
      the planet Earth, Magneto was the X-Men's first major nemesis. Now known
      as a revolutionist and terrorist, Magneto has fought for the X-Men as many
      times as heâ€™s been against them.</p>

    <h2> <a name="greengoblin" id="greengoblin"></a>GREEN GOBLIN</h2>
    <p> Known for many years as the Green Goblin and Spider-Man's arch-enemy and
      murderer of his first love Gwen Stacy , Osborn fooled the world into
      thinking he's a hero under the guise of the Iron Patriot and outed many
      heroes as cowards. His downfall was caused by his own insanity when he led
      a Siege on Asgard. He recently came back as Goblin King.</p>

    <h2> <a name="lexluthor" id="lexluthor"></a>LEX LUTHOR</h2>
    <p> Lex Luthor, Superman's arch-nemesis, is one of the most gifted beings
      alive, whose hatred of "interfering aliens" pushes him down the path of a
      sociopath. Known for his "ends justifies the means" approach to life, his
      single-minded and often brutal focus puts him at odds with The Man of
      Steel. Lex Luthor is arguably DC Comics' most iconic villain.</p>

    <h2> <a name="doctopus" id="doctopus"></a>DOCTOR OCTOPUS</h2>
    <p> A former nuclear physicist and atomic researcher, Otto Octavius' life
      changed forever when one of his experiments went horribly wrong. From that
      day forward, he has set out to prove his superior intellect in a number of
      ways, but these plans are usually thwarted by Spider-Man.</p>
